    "In preceding notebooks, performed preliminary assessments of data quality and refined the question to be answered. You found a small number of data values that gave clear choices about whether to replace values or drop a whole row. You determined that predicting the adult weekend ticket price was your primary aim. You threw away records with missing price data, but not before making the most of the other available data to look for any patterns between the states. You didn't see any and decided to treat all states equally; the state label didn't seem to be particularly useful.\n",

    "In this notebook you'll start to build machine learning models. Before even starting with learning a machine learning model, however, start by considering how useful the mean value is as a predictor. This is more than just a pedagogical device. You never want to go to stakeholders with a machine learning model only to have the CEO point out that it performs worse than just guessing the average! Your first model is a baseline performance comparitor for any subsequent model. You then build up the process of efficiently and robustly creating and assessing models against it. The development we lay out may be little slower than in the real world, but this step of the capstone is definitely more than just instructional. It is good practice to build up an understanding that the machine learning pipelines you build work as expected. You can validate steps with your own functions for checking expected equivalence between, say, pandas and sklearn implementations."

    "So far, you've treated ski resort data as a single entity. In machine learning, when you train your model on all of your data, you end up with no data set aside to evaluate model performance. You could keep making more and more complex models that fit the data better and better and not realise you were overfitting to that one set of samples. By partitioning the data into training and testing splits, without letting a model (or missing-value imputation) learn anything about the test split, you have a somewhat independent assessment of how your model might perform in the future. An often overlooked subtlety here is that people all too frequently use the test set to assess model performance _and then compare multiple models to pick the best_. This means their overall model selection process is  fitting to one specific data set, now the test split. You could keep going, trying to get better and better performance on that one data set, but that's  where cross-validation becomes especially useful. While training models, a test split is very useful as a final check on expected future performance."

    "You could keep going, trying different values of k, training a model, measuring performance on the test set, and then picking the model with the best test set performance. There's a fundamental problem with this approach: _you're tuning the model to the arbitrary test set_! If you continue this way you'll end up with a model works well on the particular quirks of our test set _but fails to generalize to new data_. The whole point of keeping a test set is for it to be a set of that new data, to check how well our model might perform on data it hasn't seen.\n",

You partition the training set into k folds, train our model on k-1 of those folds, and calculate performance on the fold not used in training.

Thus you end up building k models on k sets of data with k estimates of how the model performs on unseen data but without having to touch the test set."

    "These results suggest that vertical drop is your biggest positive feature. This makes intuitive sense and is consistent with what you saw during the EDA work. Also, you see the area covered by snow making equipment is a strong positive as well. People like guaranteed skiing! The skiable terrain area is negatively associated with ticket price! This seems odd. People will pay less for larger resorts? There could be all manner of reasons for this. It could be  an effect whereby larger resorts can host more visitors at any one time and so can charge less per ticket. As has been mentioned previously, the data are missing information about visitor numbers. Bear in mind,  the coefficient for skiable terrain is negative _for this model_. For example, if you kept the total number of chairs and fastQuads constant, but increased the skiable terrain extent, you might imagine the resort is worse off because the chairlift capacity is stretched thinner."

Then highlight that you built a linear model and the features that found. Comment on the estimate of its performance from cross-validation and whether its performance on the test split was consistent with this estimate. Also highlight that a random forest regressor was tried, what preprocessing steps were found to be best, and again what its estimated performance via cross-validation was and whether its performance on the test set was consistent with that. State which model you have decided to use going forwards and why. This summary should provide a quick overview for someone wanting to know quickly why the given model was chosen for the next part of the business problem to help guide important business decisions."

    "I started by evaluating how useful the mean value is as a predictor, because that is the easiest method for determining values, and is what Big Mountain has done up until now to make their determinations.  \n",
    "\n",
    "With the data we already have, I removed Big Mountain's data so more accurately analyze the rest of the industry.  I then used test_train_split to randomly divide the remaining dataset, splitting 30% to x_test, y_test and the remaining 70% going to X_train, y_train.  Saving the name, state, and region fields into an external list, I was able to remove those from the dataset and be left with only numeric data.\n",
    "\n",
    "From here, I began by looking the mean of the y_train data (63.811).  Sklearn's DummyRegressor validated the mean (63.811) very closely at first glance.  The R squared coefficient of determination had a perfect match, returning a zero value.  This suggests either our model is too simple, underfitting, there isn't a linear relationship in the data, or the model is predicting the mean constantly.\n",
    "\n",
    "I created an array of length the size of the test set with the single value of the training mean in order to make predictions.  The model only predicts about .3% of the variance in the test set, which is very poor.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, I took at the mean absolute error (MSE) which was somewhat better for the test set than the train set.  The root mean square error came out to 24.78 for the y_train, and 24.11 for the y_test.\n",
    "\n",
    "The numbers collected so far were validated against the sklearn.metrics function values, which were not significantly different.  I took a break from this, though to learn about how the order in which the values are calculated using those tools makes a difference.  As near as I can tell, sklearn's mean squared error doesn't change when the submitted arguments are reversed.  But the r2_score function, r_squared, and other \"homebrewed\" functions do definitely suffer from swapping!  Argument order matters!\n",
    "\n",
    "I then moved on to what to do about missing values in pandas.  Using the median values worked well and seems to be a good option overall as long as not too many values are missing.  \n",
    "\n",
    "I then used the StandardScaler to adjust the numbers to have a zero mean and unit variance, as they were using a different scale for measurement.  Removing the mean and scaling to unit variance, a the fit method was used to get a new the mean and standard deviation of X_tr for each feature, which was then standardized and scaled using the same mean and standard deviation from the training data to maintain consistency.  I trained the model on the train split, then made predictions using the model on both train and splits.  The simple linear regression model explains about 82% of the variance on the train set and about 72% on the test set.  This is better than the DummyRegressor estimates, so I'm moving in the right direction for sampling.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, with what I've calculated so far, calculating the mean absolute error for the tests gives a range for the ticket price between $8.54 and $9.41.\n",
    "\n",
    "Changing gears, I returned to the missing values, opting to see what replacing missing data with the mean instead of the median and see how the results compare.  Running through everything else again (replacing the data, scaling to zero mean and unit variance, then training a linear regression model), the ticket price resulted in between $8.54 and $9.42, so a negligible difference overall.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sklearn has a pipline component to help with this process and, using the fit() method, all of those steps were completed much more quickly.  The predictions in this way explained about 82% of the variance on the train set and about 72% on the test set.  The absolute mean error gave a range of $8.55 and $9.41, which falls perfectly in line with earlier predictions.  Even the median mse is perfectly aligned with these results.\n",
    "\n",
    "To check if I was overfitting, I used the \"make_pipeline\" feature \"SelectKBest\" to automatically check the best K features.  Assessing performance with this setting, resulted in a r2 score of 76% and 62% on each set, which is worse than I was getting before.  \n",
    "\n",
    "I defined a new pipeline to select a different number features (rather than the 10 it appeared to be defaulting to), manually setting the k value of 15.  Fitting the pipeline again and running the numbers, the r2 score this time came to 79% and 64%, which is better, but still not as good as before.  Rather than continue to guess what the proper value ought to be, cross-validatation was next applied.\n",
    "\n",
    "The cross_validate function combined with GridSearchCV would allow me to determine a k value that gives the best performance.  I used the \"get_params()\" function of \"pipe\" to build a dictionary of available parameters, then fed that into the GridSearchCV utility. It estimated the \"best\" k value to train the final model using only the top 8 most relevant features from the dataset. I graphed this out to see what it estimated.  Naturally, the plot clearly demonstrated this result. \n",
